# ChatBot

## Problem Statement 
Imagine that you’re working for an airline. Your task is to reduce their support team workload by creating a chatbot that can direct visitors to the correct page (e.g. the flight search). Unknown inputs are still handled with the help of a human.

The product team is asking you to help them build that tool and to estimate the workload reduction. Further, a process should be mapped out to ensure the bot’s accuracy over time. What would your advice be?
